Updated with composer json v4.0 

Please note - this plugin is not actively supported and no updates will be looked at unless it annoys me directly in my daily business use.
Feel free to fork and modify to your hearts content

## Features
- Database driven navigation assembly
- Admin and Primary navigation placement with order
- Display within Mautic iframe or open in a new browser tab

## Limitations 
- Plugin activation is automatic, havent figured out how the plugin enable works
- individual nav items currently do not respect the ability to enable/disable
- No ability currently to control visibility by role, so turns on for all

## Instructions 
- Copy folder to the plugin directory
- Rename the plugin directory folder to "CustomNavigationLinksBundle"
- Make sure you have full read/write access to the folder (the plugin will be rebuilding config files in the directory)
- Install Plugin
- Clear cache
- Navigate to plugin via admin menu /s/navlinks/1
- Create new
 - Select Location (Admin/Primary)
 - Label of the link
 - URL of the link
 - Nav type (_blank, iframe)
 - Save and Close
 - Clear Cache After Install and every modification/new link (This will rebuild the config files, update and recompile everything)
